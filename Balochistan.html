<h3><u>Description</u></h3>
<p>
    The history of the Sibi region dates back to the 7th century at the earliest, when it was ruled by the Sewa dynasty.[3] In the early 13th century, Sibi was a dependency of Multan under Nasiruddin Qabacha of the Ghurid Empire. The area was then variously subject to Multan or Sindh throughout much of its history. The Arghun dynasty of Kandahar invaded in the late 15th century and seized Sibi from the Samma dynasty of Sindh, but it was returned to Sindh during the Mughal period.[4][5] Sibi was governed by the Kalhora dynasty during the early 18th century, which in turn paid tribute to the Afsharids after Nader Shah's invasion in 1737. In 1747, the Durrani Empire assumed control of Sibi[6] and appointed local administrators from the Barozai clan.
