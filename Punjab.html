<h3><u>Description</u></h3>
<p>
    Rawalpindi is on the Pothohar Plateau, known for its ancient Hindu and Buddhist heritage, especially in the neighbouring town of Taxila, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.[6] In 1765, the ruling Gakhars were defeated and the city came under Sikh rule, becoming an important city within the Sikh Empire based at Lahore. The city's Babu Mohallah neighbourhood was once home to a community of Jewish traders that had fled Mashhad, Persia, in the 1830s.[7] The city was conquered by the British Raj in 1849, and in the late 19th century became the largest garrison town of the British Indian Army's Northern command as its climate suited the British authorities.[8][9] Britain's army elevated the city from a small town to the third largest city in Punjab by 1921.[8] Following the partition of British India in 1947, the city became home to the headquarters of the Pakistan Army, retaining its status as a major military city.
